# String Constructors and String Pool

```java
String color1 = "red";
String color2 = new String("red");
String color3 = "red";
```

How many `String` objects are created?

## Incorrect

1

> Incorrect. Since `color1` and `color2` are assigned the same string literal "red",
> Java will create and reuse one `String` object in the string pool. However, `color2`
> will reference a new object due to the `String` constructor call.
