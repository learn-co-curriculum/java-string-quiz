# String Manipulation

```java
String s1 = "hi";
s1.toUpperCase();
```

Fill in the blank to show the output.


System.out.println( s1 ); [answer1]

## Correct

- hi
- answer1

> You are correct! Strings are immutable, so `s1.toUpperCase();` does not change `s1`.  The
> upper-cased string returned from the method should be assigned to a variable, such as `String upper = s1.toUpperCase();`.
